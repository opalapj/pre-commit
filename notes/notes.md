# Installation

    pipx install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts

    pre-commit install

# Running

- `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`:

        git commit -m "Commit msg"

- this is what `pre-commit` runs by default when committing:

        pre-commit run

    > This will run all hooks against currently staged files.

- run all the hooks against all the files:

        pre-commit run --all-files

    > This will run all hooks against all the files (not only staged).
    > This is a useful invocation if you are using pre-commit in CI.
